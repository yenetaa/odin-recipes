    <h2>Quote</h2>
    <p><em><strong>"People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That’s how they define
                reality. But what does it mean to be ‘correct’ or ‘true’? They’re merely vague concepts… their reality
                may all be a mirage."</strong></em></p>
